# TowersOfHanoi_visual_recursion
A visualization of the recursive solution at work + a working, user-playable version of the game.

Inspired by these visualizations of sorting algorithms: https://visualgo.net/en/sorting

The recursive algorithm for solving Towers of Hanoi is very simple.
But while I could play and "win" the game as a human, I found it hard to connect that to the logic of the algo.

Approach:
  - First build a working version of the game that a user can play
  - Add on a recursive solution
  - Layer on visual cues to help a user understand what the algo is doing

Built in pygame -- a simple framework for visualizing and managing game objects.
